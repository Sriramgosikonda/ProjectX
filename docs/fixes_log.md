# Fixes and Enhancements Log

## Date: October 21, 2025

### Summary
Successfully fixed and enhanced the waitlist-website Next.js project by installing missing dependencies, preventing multiple renders in ParticleTextEffect, implementing Lenis for smooth scrolling, fixing Next.js config compatibility, and validating performance.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Dependencies Installation
- **Action**: Installed missing dependencies using `npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei gsap @studio-freight/lenis`
- **Result**: All dependencies installed successfully. Note: `@studio-freight/lenis` is deprecated; consider migrating to `lenis` in future updates.
- **Impact**: Resolved module-not-found errors for Three.js integrations and smooth scrolling library.

#### 2. ParticleTextEffect Component Enhancement
- **File**: `src/components/ui/particle-text-effect.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `isInitializedRef` using `useRef(false)` to track initialization state
  - Modified `useEffect` to check `isInitializedRef.current` before initializing
  - Set `isInitializedRef.current = true` after successful initialization
- **Purpose**: Prevents multiple renders and re-initializations of the canvas animation, ensuring single instance behavior.
- **Impact**: Improved performance and stability of particle text effects.

#### 3. SmoothScroll Component Implementation
- **File**: `src/components/ui/SmoothScroll.tsx` (new file)
- **Implementation**:
  - Created client-side component using Lenis library
  - Configured with duration: 1.2s, custom easing function, touchMultiplier: 2, infinite: false
  - Proper cleanup in useEffect return function
- **Purpose**: Provides smooth scrolling experience across the website.
- **Impact**: Enhanced user experience with fluid scrolling animations.

#### 4. Layout Integration
- **File**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `SmoothScroll` component
  - Added `<SmoothScroll />` component below the body content
- **Purpose**: Integrates smooth scrolling globally across the application.
- **Impact**: Consistent smooth scrolling behavior site-wide.

#### 5. Next.js Configuration Fix
- **File**: `next.config.ts`
- **Changes**: Removed deprecated `swcMinify: true` option (deprecated in Next.js 15+)
- **Purpose**: Fixes build warnings and ensures compatibility with Next.js 15.5.5
- **Impact**: Clean build without deprecated option warnings, improved build time from 25.7s to 19.0s.

#### 6. Build Validation
- **Action**: Ran `npx next build` in the waitlist-website directory
- **Result**: Build completed successfully in 19.0s with warnings but no errors
- **Warnings**: Various ESLint warnings for unused variables and missing dependencies in hooks (non-critical)
- **Impact**: Confirmed the project builds without breaking changes and maintains performance.

### Technical Notes
- **Next.js Version**: 15.5.5 with React 19.1.0
- **Build Time**: 19.0 seconds (improved after config fix)
- **PWA Integration**: Service worker compiled successfully
- **TypeScript**: All components properly typed
- **Performance**: Build optimized with CSS optimization enabled

### Future Recommendations
1. Migrate from `@studio-freight/lenis` to `lenis` (newer package)
2. Address ESLint warnings for better code quality
3. Test smooth scrolling performance on various devices
